# 25Days25Langs  

🎄 **Advent of Code 2024: 25 Days, 25 Languages** 🎄  

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This year, I’m tackling the challenge with a twist: solving each daily puzzle in a **different programming language**. This is both a fun way to explore new technologies and a test of my problem-solving and adaptability skills.

## 💡 What is Advent of Code?  
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event featuring daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. It’s a fun way to improve your skills, compete with others, and enjoy the holiday season!  

---

## 🚀 My Personal Challenge  
- **25 Days, 25 Languages**: Each day’s puzzle will be solved using a unique programming language.  
- **Learning Focus**: I’ll explore different paradigms, ecosystems, and tools.  
- **Self-Imposed Rules**: See the [`RULES.md`](./RULES.md) file for the detailed constraints I’ve set for myself.

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each day’s puzzle will have its own folder structured like this:  

dayXX-<language>/
├── solution.<ext>       # The code solution
├── input.txt            # Puzzle input file (if provided)
├── output.txt           # Result output (optional)
└── README.md            # Explanation of the approach and language-specific notes

---

## 📖 How to Run the Solutions  
Instructions for running each day’s solution will be included in the respective `README.md` file in the daily folder.  

General guidelines:  
- Install the language runtime or compiler (if not already installed).  
- Run the solution using the respective command for the language (e.g., `python solution.py`, `rustc solution.rs`).  

---

## 📝 Documentation and Insights  
- **Challenges & Learnings**: I’ll document my approach, insights, and struggles in each day’s `README.md`.  
- **RULES.md**: Check out my [rules](./RULES.md) for additional context and constraints.
