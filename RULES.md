# Self-Imposed Rules for 25Days25Langs  

To make this challenge more meaningful and fair, I’m setting the following ground rules for myself:  

## 1. No LLMs or AI Assistance  
- I will not use AI tools (like ChatGPT or Copilot) for code suggestions or explanations.  
- The goal is to rely on my own understanding and problem-solving skills.  

## 2. Limited External Resources  
- I can only refer to:  
  - Official documentation for each language.  
  - Stack Overflow for troubleshooting and syntax clarification.  
- No tutorials, blog posts, or pre-written solutions are allowed.  

## 3. Language-Specific Learning  
- I may take up to **30 minutes** to learn the basics of a new language before starting the day’s puzzle.  
- Beyond that, I must figure things out as I go.  

## 4. Handwritten Solutions Only  
- All code must be written manually—no auto-generated templates or code snippets.  
- Even for boilerplate, I must type it out myself.  

## 5. Debugging Rules  
- I can use the language’s built-in debugging tools or print statements.  
- External debugging tools or IDE-specific features (like IntelliJ’s debugger) are off-limits.  

## 6. No Looking at Other Solutions  
- I won’t look at anyone else’s Advent of Code solutions until I’ve completed my own for that day.  

## 7. Share Challenges and Insights  
- If I get stuck or can’t finish within the day, I’ll document where I struggled and what I learned.  
- Failure is part of the process, and I’ll embrace it as a learning opportunity.  

## 8. Stick to Vanilla Features  
- I’ll aim to use the core features of each language without relying on excessive libraries or frameworks.  
- Exception: If the language lacks a native feature (e.g., JSON parsing), I can use one minimal library.  

## 9. Respect the Timebox  
- I’ll spend no more than **3 hours per puzzle** (including learning time).  
- If unfinished, I’ll commit whatever I have with notes on where I got stuck.  

## 10. Enjoy the Journey  
- This is about growth and exploration, not perfection. Each puzzle is an opportunity to try something new and have fun!

These rules will ensure I stay focused on learning and exploring while keeping the challenge fair and engaging.
